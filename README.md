Pixel Recurrent Neural Networks

A probability density strategy is used to solve the unsupervised learning challenge of generative picture modeling. An image model that is both expressive, tractable, and scalable is needed for this purpose. We describe a deep neural network that predicts pixels sequentially over two spatial dimensions in an image. With a fixed dependence range and Masked convolutions, a second simpler PixelCNN architecture is also put out. The PixelCNN outputs a conditional distribution at each point while maintaining the spatial resolution of the input across all layers. The model benefits from representational and training advantages when the pixels are modeled as discrete values with a multinomial distribution implemented using softmax. Benchmarks for the varied ImageNet dataset are also provided by our key findings. The model produces samples that are clear, diverse, and generally coherent.
